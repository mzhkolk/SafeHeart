# SafeHeart

Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligenceâ€“based methods can be used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning systems.

SafeHeart is the first study to prospectively collect a multimodal data set to construct a personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy.
